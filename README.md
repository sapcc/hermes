# Hermes

**Hermes** is an audit trail service for OpenStack. It is named after the Futurama character, not the Greek god.

The audit trail is a stream of audit events produced by the various components of our converged cloud solution.
Each audit event represents an audit-relevant activity in
[CADF format](http://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP0262_1.0.0.pdf).

The website for CADF can be found [here](http://www.dmtf.org/standards/cadf).

## Features 

[Hermes Service](./docs/operators-guide.md) 
* OpenStack Identity v3 authentication and authorization
* Project and domain-level access control (scoping)
* Compatible with other cloud based audit APIs 

# Installation 

Via Makefule:

* `make` to just compile and run the binaries from the `build/` directory
* `make && make install` to install to `/usr`
* `make && make install PREFIX=/some/path` to install to `/some/path`
* `make docker` to build the Docker image (set image name and tag with the `DOCKER_IMAGE` and `DOCKER_TAG` variables)


# Using Hermes

Hermes can be used via our [Converged Cloud Dashboard Elektra](https://github.com/sapcc/elektra) 
via "Auditing" or directly as web API.

The Hermes binary is for running the server. There is no client binary for connecting to Hermes.

# Operating Hermes

The easiest way to deploy Hermes is as a service in Kubernetes.

Feel free to use our [Hermes helm chart](https://github.com/sapcc/helm-charts/tree/master/openstack/hermes)
which contains Hermes deployment, and an ELK deployment for adding Project ID and Domain ID to CADF events generated by Keystone Middleware.

Follow the [Hermes operators guide](./docs/operators-guide.md) to learn how to setup the 
Hermes service from scratch and integrate it with OpenStack.

## List events

**GET /v1/events**

Lists a project’s or domain's audit events. The project or domain comes from the 
scope of the authentication token, but can be overriden by a request parameter.

The list of events can be filtered by the parameters passed in via the URL.

Only basic event data will be listed here (event id, event type, resource id,
resource type, user name). Clients must make a separate call to retrieve the full 
CADF payload data for each individual event.

**Parameters**

| **Name** | **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| observer_type | string | Selects all events with source similar to this value. |
| target\_type | string | Selects all events related to this resource type. |
| target\_id | string | Selects all events related to this specific resource instance. |
| initiator\_id | string | Selects all events caused by this initiator (usually an OpenStack user ID) |
| initiator\_type | string | Selects all events caused by this initiator type (user or system) |
| action | string | Selects all events representing activities of this type. |
| outcome | string | Selects all events based on the activity result (e.g. failed) |
| time | string | Date filter to select all events with _eventTime_ matching the specified criteria. See Date Filters below for more detail. |
| offset | integer | The starting index within the total list of the events that you would like to retrieve. |
| limit | integer | The maximum number of records to return (up to 100). The default limit is 10. |
| sort | string | Determines the sorted order of the returned list. See Sorting below for more detail. |
| domain\_id | string | Selects all events in this domain (requires special permissions). |
| project\_id | string | Selects all events in this project (requires special permissions). |

**Scope:**

If `domain_id` is specified, only events for that domain (at domain level, e.g. project creation) will be returned.

If `project_id` is specified, only events for that project will be returned.

If *both* are specified, *no events will be returned*.

If neither is specified, then the scope of the client's X-Auth-Token will be used.

**Date Filters:**

The value for the `time` parameter is a comma-separated list of time stamps in ISO 
8601 format. The time stamps can be prefixed with any of these comparison operators:
`gt:` (greater-than), `gte:` (greater-than-or-equal), `lt:` (less-than), `lte:` 
(less-than-or-equal).

For example, to get a list of events from May of 2017:
```
GET /v1/events?time=gte:2017-05-01T00:00:00,lt:2017-06-01T00:00:00
```

**Sorting:**

The value of the sort parameter is a comma-separated list of sort keys. Supported 
sort keys include `time`, `observer_type`, `target_type`, `target_id`, `initiator_type`, `initiator_id`, `outcome` and
 `action`.

Each sort key may also include a direction. Supported directions are `:asc` for 
ascending and `:desc` for descending. The service will use `:asc` for every key 
that does not include a direction.

For example, to sort the list from most recently created to oldest:

```
GET /v1/events?sort=time:desc
```

**Request:**

```
GET /v1/events?offset=1&limit=2&sort=time

Headers:
    Accept: application/json
    X-Auth-Token: {keystone_token}
```

**Response:**

This example shows the audit events for adding a role to a user.

## Attributes

**GET /v1/attributes/<attribute_name>**

Returns the unique values of a given attribute, so that you can e.g. have users select from them.

`GET /v1/attributes/action`

returns

```json 
[
  "update/add/floatingip",
  "update/remove/floatingip"
]
```
**Parameters**

| **Name** | **Type** | **Description** | **Default** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| max_depth | integer | max. depth / level of detail of hierarchical values | infinity / unlimited |
| limit | integer | limit of values returned | 50 | 

### Hierarchical Values

To support adjustable levels of detail, _type URIs_ and _actions_ in the CADF taxonomy are organized in hierarchies. Classifiers start with the most general classification followed by a theoretically unlimited number of sub-classifications, separated by slashes `/`.

Examples:
* `update/add/floatingip`
* `network/firewall/rules`

To limit the amount of classifier values exposed to a client, the level of detail of hierarchical attributes can be limited using the `max_depth` parameter. 

Example:

Given the following list of actual values for the `action` attribute, the `attributes` API will have a different result, depending on the `max_depth` parameter.

List:
* `create`
* `delete`
* `update`
* `update/add/floatingip`
* `update/add/security-group`
* `update/remove/floatingip`
* `update/remove/security-group`
* `start`
* `stop`

| max_depth | values |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| 1         | `create, delete, update, start, stop  |
| 2         | `create, delete, update, update/add, update/remove, start, stop |
| 3         | full list (see above) |
